## Game Development
![Super Boson](https://img.itch.zone/aW1nLzMzMDI2MzYucG5n/315x250%23c/nK0raO.png)  

I've designed and developed various small games in Unity with C#, including a puzzle action game about Particle Physics called Super Boson that won the 2018 BAFTA Young Game Designers Game Making Award, which you can read about [here](https://www.bafta.org/supporting-talent/young-game-designers/prithvi-kohli-young-game-designer). I made a new version of the game that I showcased at EGX 2019, which you can see [here](https://prithvikohligames.itch.io/super-boson-demo). I was also a Game Design Intern at Bossa Studios in 2019.
